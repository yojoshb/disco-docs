### Documentation to install Red Hat OpenShift in a air-gapped/disconnected environment

> Currently a WIP

Mostly regurgitates Red Hat's docs in a more streamlined fashion that may be easier to follow. Includes common installation scenario examples and is able to be used completely offline for ease-of-use (other than the links to Red Hat docs). 

- Docs are built using [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
