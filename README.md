### Documentation to install Red Hat OpenShift in a air-gapped/disconnected environment

> Currently a WIP

Mostly regurgitates Red Hat's docs in a more streamlined fashion that may be easier to follow. Includes common installation scenario examples and is able to be used completely offline for ease-of-use (other than external links to Red Hat docs). This installation method is based on using the Agent-based Installer and associated tools (oc-mirror).

- Docs are built using [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
- Additional Extensions used:
    - [mkdocs-print-site-plugin](https://timvink.github.io/mkdocs-print-site-plugin/index.html)
    - [mkdocs-to-pdf](https://mkdocs-to-pdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/)
    - [mkdocs-autorefs](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/autorefs/)
