## Download necessary tools
Be aware of the tool(s) version and architecture. Certain tools require matching to the version of OpenShift you're installing and the correct binary for the RHEL version that you are using. 

- [Red Hat Console Downloads](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads){:target="_blank"} has the latest-stable version of all the tools. 
- Look through the [public mirror site](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/){:target="_blank"} if you need to get a specific version. Red Hat console downloads come from this site.
- Or access specific versions through the [OCP downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290){:target="_blank"}

    !!! info
        You can use the `rhel-oc-tools.sh` script in the docs repository that will download all the tools for you if you'd like. Make sure to edit the script's variables to define what version/arch/binaries you want to download.

        Set up up your [Red Hat pull-secret](#grab-your-pull-secret-from-your-red-hat-account) before using the script if you intend to extract the `openshift-installer` as it will need valid credentials for access.

    - You can use the latest-stable version available for your architecture. `oc` newer than your cluster version may have additional capabilities that your cluster cannot use.
    - RHEL 9 latest-stable: `wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux-amd64-rhel9.tar.gz`
    - RHEL 8 latest-stable: `wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux-amd64-rhel8.tar.gz`

- **oc-mirror**: Awesome oc cli plugin to streamline getting the required images mirrored and packed into a `.tar` file to transfer to the high-side. Also used to upload the images into your mirror registry on the high-side once they are brought over.
    - [Red Hat Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/disconnected_environments/mirroring-in-disconnected-environments#about-installing-oc-mirror-v2){:target="_blank"}
    - Always use the latest version available for your architecture.
    - **oc-mirror v2** is new, and GA'd for OpenShift 4.18, but is backwards compatible with older releases down to v4.12.
    - RHEL 9 latest: `wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest/oc-mirror.rhel9.tar.gz`
    - RHEL 8 latest: `wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest/oc-mirror.tar.gz`

- **openshift-install**: Program that will create the OpenShift install disk that will bootstrap and install the cluster on your hardware. 
    
    !!! warning "Important"
        This binary is specific to the release version of OpenShift you are installing. The binary must match the release images that you mirror.
    - This doc will go over the extraction method to make sure the correct binary is downloaded for the release images mirrored. 
  ---

- **mirror-registry** (optional): Small registry that can host the required container images to install, update, and maintain the cluster.

## Grab your pull-secret from your Red Hat Account 
[Red Hat Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/disconnected_environments/mirroring-in-disconnected-environments#installation-adding-registry-pull-secret_installing-mirroring-disconnected){:target="_blank"}

1. Download or copy your [pull secret from the Red Hat OpenShift Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret){:target="_blank"}. These are your credentials for accessing Red Hat container registries.

1. Make a copy of your pull secret in readable JSON format:
```{ .bash }
cat ./pull-secret | jq . > rh-pull-secret.json
``` 

1. Specify the path to the folder to store the pull secret in and a name for the JSON file that you create. You can store this file in `/home/$USER/.docker/config.json` or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`. If one of the directories aren't there, create them.
    - The contents of the file resemble the following example:
```{ .json .no-copy title="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json" }
{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

1. Verify you can authenticate to `registry.redhat.io`
```{ .bash }
podman login registry.redhat.io
```
```{ . .no-copy title="Example Output" }
Authenticating with existing credentials for registry.redhat.io
Existing credentials are valid. Already logged in to registry.redhat.io
```

## Install/configure tools

1. Put `oc` and `oc-mirror` tools we need on the low-side in your `$PATH`. Either `/usr/local/bin` or somewhere like `/home/$USER/bin` or `/home/$USER/.local/bin`
```{ .bash .no-copy }
sudo tar -xzvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

# RHEL 8
sudo tar -xzvf oc-mirror.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

# RHEL 9
sudo tar -xzvf oc-mirror.rhel9.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/{oc,oc-mirror}

# If selinux is enabled
sudo restorecon -v /usr/local/bin/{oc,oc-mirror}
```
1. Make sure you have set the umask parameter to `0022` on the operating system that uses oc-mirror
```{ .bash }
umask 0022
```

1. Verify that the oc-mirror v2 plugin is successfully installed by running the following command
```{ .bash }
oc mirror --v2 --help
```

!!! info
    If the system is STIG'd and using fapolicyd either disable it, or make changes as it automatically blocks any binary that is not an RPM.

    You can add the binaries to the policy like so:
    
    ```{ .bash .no-copy }
    systemctl stop fapolicyd.service
    
    sudo fapolicyd-cli --file add /usr/local/bin/oc
    sudo fapolicyd-cli --file add /usr/local/bin/oc-mirror
    sudo fapolicyd-cli --update
    
    systemctl start fapolicyd.service; systemctl status fapolicyd.service
    ```
