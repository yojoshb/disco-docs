# OpenShift in a Disconnected Environment: Streamlined
This documentions purpose is for consolidating information to stand up a OpenShift v4.12 and later cluster, either HA or SNO, in a disconnected environment. This in not a one-size fits all, this is not specific to any team/org, this is rough and simple to at least put the important things to know in one centralized document. Relevant Red Hat docs/articles will be linked in each section if applicable.
