# Installing OpenShift in a Disconnected/Air-Gapped Environment: Streamlined
This documents purpose is for consolidating information to stand up a OpenShift v4.14 and later cluster in a disconnected/air-gap environment using the agent-based installer on bare metal/virtual machine. 

This in not a one-size fits all, this is not specific to any team/org, this is rough and simple to at least put the important information in one centralized document. 

This documentation was written for OpenShift v4.17, but you can follow this process for any version later than v4.14, just sub in whatever version of the platform you want.

- Relevant docs/articles are linked in each section if applicable. 
- Commands are be included within the documention as well as any associated output.
