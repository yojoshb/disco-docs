# Disconnected Cluster Install

[Red Hat Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/disconnected_environments/installing-disconnected-environments#installing-agent_installing-disconnected-environments){:target="_blank"}

Now that the images have been uploaded/mirrored to your environment we can build the cluster ISO and boot OpenShift.

The general flow of a disconnected OpenShift install: 

1. Create the required cluster config files.
1. Create the ISO defined by the cluster config files.
1. Boot the ISO on your machines.
1. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin.
1. Profit??
