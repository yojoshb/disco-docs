## Creating cluster configs and building the agent ISO

Here is where the cluster is defined. We'll use two files, `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` along with the `openshift-install` binary we extracted earlier to create the install `agent.iso`. Examples are given below. Create a directory somewhere to house the config files. This directory will also hold the credentials for API access to the cluster when it is built.


1. Install nmstate

```bash
$ sudo dnf install /usr/bin/nmstatectl -y
```

1. Create a directory to store the cluster configuration, we'll call this directory `my_cluster` for this example and it's in the $HOME directory

```bash
$ mkdir ~/my_cluster
```

1. Create the files `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` in the directory you defined.

The example below builds a bare metal compact cluster (HA: 3 master nodes) with static IP's. The cluster is called `cluster.example.com`. Each node is called m(1-3).cluster.example.com. 

- **install-config.yaml**: This defines your cluster configuration, click on the `+` signs to get a general description of some the values
  
  You can look at several [install-config.yaml examples here in this document](../examples/install-configs.md)
  
  ```yaml title="install-config.yaml: Compact cluster"
  apiVersion: v1
  baseDomain: example.com # (1)! The base domain name of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.
  compute:
  - architecture: amd64 # (2)! Specify the system architecture. Valid values are amd64, arm64, ppc64le, and s390x.
    hyperthreading: Enabled
    name: worker
    replicas: 0 # (3)! This parameter controls the number of compute machines that the Agent-based installation waits to discover before triggering the installation process. It is the number of compute machines that must be booted with the generated ISO.
  controlPlane:
    architecture: amd64
    hyperthreading: Enabled
    name: master
    replicas: 3 # (4)! The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
  metadata:
    name: cluster # (5)! The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
  networking:
    clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14 # (6)! The network that the cluster shares for assigning IPs to PODS. Each node will get a /23 (500~ usable IP addresses). Make sure this IP space does not conflict with anything on your LAN.
      hostPrefix: 23
    machineNetwork:
    - cidr: 172.16.1.0/24 # (7)! The network that connects the cluster to your LAN. This is the IP space that resides on your LAN.
    networkType: OVNKubernetes
    serviceNetwork:
    - 172.30.0.0/16 # (8)! Used for internal service objects. Make sure this IP space does not conflict with anything on your LAN.
  platform:

      ingressVIPs:
        - 172.16.1.4 # (10)! Ingress API ip address
  fips: true # (11)! Boolean: Either true or false to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead
  pullSecret: '{"auths":{"registry.example.com:8443": {"auth": "am9zaDpLSW....","email": ""}}}' # (12)! A pull secret for your internal image registry
  sshKey: 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABg....' # (13)! Public ssh key that you define. This key will give ssh access to the nodes through the 'core' user. This is the only way to ssh into the nodes

  1. The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
  2. Can be the IP of any one of the master nodes. This node will become bootstrap machine during install. A worker cannot be the rendezvous machine.
  3. Hostname of the node, must be resolvable by DNS.
  4. Recommended to explicitly define roles for your hosts, especially if you're defining masters and workers as they would otherwise be applied at random.
  5. Name of the interface. If you do not know it, the installer scripts will detect the actual name by mac-address.
  6. Required! The MAC address of an interface on the host, used to determine which host to apply the configuration to.
  7. The static IP address of the target bare metal host.
  8. The static IP addressâ€™s subnet prefix for the target bare metal host.
  9. The DNS server for the target bare metal host.
  10. The default gateway, or default route of your node. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the specified interface.

### Validation checks 
The Agent-based Installer performs validation checks on user defined YAML files before the ISO is created. Once the validations are successful, the agent ISO is created.

**`install-config.yaml`**

  - `baremetal`, `vsphere` and `none` platforms are supported.
  - If `none` is used as a platform, the number of control plane replicas must be `1` and the total number of worker replicas must be `0`.
  - The `networkType` parameter must be `OVNKubernetes` in the case of none platform. Stick with `OVNKubernetes` for all installs.
  - `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` parameters must be set for bare metal and vSphere platforms.
  - Some host-specific fields in the bare metal platform configuration that have equivalents in `agent-config.yaml` file are ignored. A warning message is logged if these fields are set.

**`agent-config.yaml`**

  - Each interface must have a defined MAC address. Additionally, all interfaces must have a different MAC address.
  - At least one interface must be defined for each host.
  - World Wide Name (WWN) vendor extensions are not supported in root device hints.
  - The `role` parameter in the `host` object must have a value of either `master` or `worker`.

## Creating the agent image

1. Your cluster build directory should look like this
```bash
$ tree my_cluster
my_cluster
â”œâ”€â”€ agent-config.yaml
â””â”€â”€ install-config.yaml

0 directories, 2 files
```

1. Make a copy of this directory and it's contents. When you run `openshift-install` against it, all the files are consumed to build the image. A backup is a good idea incase of any issues that may arrise.
```bash
$ cp -R my_cluster/ my_cluster_bak/
```

1. Create the agent image
```bash
$ openshift-install --dir my_cluster/ agent create image
