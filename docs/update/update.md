## Inspect cluster resources
From your `oc mirror` command, you could have the following files in your working-dir i.e. `/opt/4.17-mirrordata/working-dir/cluster-resources/`. It all depends on what you mirrored. 

  - `idms-oc-mirror.yaml`: This is a list of mappings between the original public registry and your local registry for all images that are identified by their digest (ImageDigestMirrorSet).
  - `itms-oc-mirror.yaml`: This is a list of mappings between the original public registry and your local registry for all images that are identified by their tag (ImageTagMirrorSet).
  - `cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml/cc-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml`: This is the CatalogSource/ClusterCatalog for RedHat Operators. 
      
    !!! warning "Important!"
        Change the **name** the `cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml/cc-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml` catalog source ==in the YAML== file to `redhat-operators` as some operators are hardcoded reference this exact catalog source name. Examples below with the highlighted value:
        
        !!! tip
            Use a quick `sed` command to set the name in both files
            ```bash
            sed -i 's/name: cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-17/name: redhat-operators/' /opt/4.17-mirrordata/working-dir/cluster-resources/cs-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml
            sed -i 's/name: cc-redhat-operator-index-v4-17/name: redhat-operators/' /opt/4.17-mirrordata/working-dir/cluster-resources/cc-redhat-operator-index-v4-17.yaml
            ```

  - `cs-certified-operator-index-v4-17.yaml`: This is the catalog for operators certified by Red Hat but not necessarily developed by Red Hat.
  - `cs-community-operator-index-v4-17.yaml`: This is the catalog source for all community based operators.

## Apply the cluster resources

[Red Hat Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/disconnected_environments/mirroring-in-disconnected-environments#oc-mirror-updating-cluster-manifests-v2_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2){:target="_blank"}

1. If you have OSUS configured, when you apply the newly updates resources the cluster will pick up on the new images and be ready for the updates.

1. Apply the cluster recources generated by the oc-mirror plugin. This will make your cluster aware of the catalog resources we mirrored earlier so you can utilze OperatorHub to install operators. This will overwrite the resources you applied early when installing the cluster.
```{ .bash }
oc apply -f /opt/4.17-mirrordata/working-dir/cluster-resources/
```
```{ . .no-copy title="Example Output" }

```

1. If you mirrored release images, apply the release image signatures
```{ .bash }
oc apply -f /opt/4.17-mirrordata/cluster-resources/signature-configmap.json
```

1. Your cluster should now be ready to be updated via WebUI or CLI.
