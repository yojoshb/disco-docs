The general flow of a disconnected OpenShift install goes like this: 

**Connected Process**

1. Download the required tools from Red Hat.
1. Create an image set configuration file.
1. Mirror an image set to disk.
1. Transfer the image set and associated tools to the target disconnected environment.

**Disconnected Process**

1. Upload the image set to the disconnected mirror registry.
1. Create the cluster configs and build the ISO.
1. Boot the the ISO onto your hardware.
1. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin.

### Basic Prerequisites
Online connected (low-side)
    
  - A Red Hat account and valid OpenShift subscription
  - RHEL 8/9 or compatible WSL machine that can access the internet (Red Hat's CDN, registry.redhat.io, quay.io)
  - Adequate disk space either on the machine and transfer disk, or just the transfer disk: 100GB+ (Dependant on what you bring over from the connected network)
  - Data transfer capabilities (connected to disconnected)

Offline disconnected (high-side) 
  
  - A machine that can access the network that the cluster will be installed to
  - Adequate disk space on the disconnected machine: 100GB+ (Dependant on what you want to install)
  - A docker v2-2 capable registry with adequate storage space 100GB+ (If you do not have a registry in your environment, you can use the [mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installing-mirroring-creating-registry))
  
    !!! info "If you want to use the Red Hat provided mirror registry, the machine must be able to run Podman. Changes to the machine may need to happen that may violate the DISA STIG."
  
  - DNS server
  - NTP server/source

### Cluster Resources

Recommended cluster resources for the following topologies:

|Topology            |# of master nodes |# of worker nodes |vCPU    |Memory       |Storage |
|-                   |-                 |-                 |-       |-            |-       |
|Single-node cluster |1                 |0                 |8 vCPUs |16 GB of RAM |120 GB  |
|Compact cluster     |3                 |0 or 1            |8 vCPUs |16 GB of RAM |120 GB  |
|HA cluster          |3                 |2 and above       |8 vCPUs |16 GB of RAM |120 GB  |


### FIPS Compliance
Only pertains to the install being performed on the high-side.

**OpenShift version 4.12 to 4.15** 

To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a RHEL 8 computer that is configured to operate in FIPS mode. Running RHEL 9 with FIPS mode enabled to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster is not possible.

---

**OpenShift version 4.16 and later** 

To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a RHEL 9 computer that is configured to operate in FIPS mode, and you must use a FIPS-capable version of the installation program.
